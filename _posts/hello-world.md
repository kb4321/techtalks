There are several benefits to buying a cheaper product that is comparable in value to a more expensive one:

Cost savings: The most obvious benefit of buying a cheaper product is cost savings. You can get a product that performs the same function as a more expensive one but at a lower price point. This can be especially beneficial if you're on a tight budget or want to save money for other expenses.

More affordable upgrades: If you choose a cheaper product, you may have more budget left over to upgrade other parts of your setup. For example, if you're buying a computer and choose a cheaper model, you may be able to upgrade the RAM or hard drive to improve its performance.

Lower risk: Buying a cheaper product can also be a lower risk proposition. If you're not sure whether you'll like a particular product or whether it will meet your needs, buying a cheaper version can be a way to test it out without spending too much money. If it doesn't work out, you can always upgrade to a more expensive product later.

Environmental impact: Cheaper products often have a lower environmental impact than their more expensive counterparts. This is because they may be made with fewer resources or have a shorter lifespan, leading to less waste and pollution. By choosing a cheaper product, you can reduce your environmental footprint.

Reduced pressure to take care of the product: If you buy a cheaper product, you may feel less pressure to take care of it or worry less if it gets damaged or lost. This can be a benefit if you're looking for a product that you can use without worrying too much about its maintenance or replacement cost.

Overall, buying a cheaper product that is comparable in value to a more expensive one can be a smart decision in many cases, depending on your needs and priorities. It can help you save money, reduce your environmental impact, and enjoy the benefits of a product without spending too much or feeling too much pressure to take care of it.
